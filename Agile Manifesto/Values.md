# Values

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

__Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools

__Working software__ over comprehensive documentation

__Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation

__Responding to change__ over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
