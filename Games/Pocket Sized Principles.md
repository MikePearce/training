# Pocket Sized Principles

## Timing: 15 minutes

## Ingredients:

- Copies of the twelve principles of agile software
- White-boards and/or flip-charts
- Markers

## Recipe:

In their existing form, it is challenging for people to read and understand each principle and, just as importantly, to easily refer to them later.

1. Divide participants in to groups, each with a white-board or flip-chart and markers.
1. Have the teams write down the numbers 1 through 12.
1. Challenge each team to, within a 15 minute time-box, come up with three words maximum that effectively capture each of the twelve principles.
1. When time is up, go through each principle and discuss which are the most important words. Sometimes I like to ask people what their most and least favorite principles are.
1. Post the condensed principles somewhere visible, so as to make it a regular talking point.


## Learning Points:
- This is an effective way of capturing each principle in a much more concise and memorable way.
- Probably the most valuable part of this exercise, is in the discussion that the teams have when trying to come up with the words. They need to first understand the principle before breaking it down.
- Teams can establish a collective understanding and ownership of each principle.
- This also makes for a good review exercise in a classroom environment.
