# European Road Trip

## Timing: 30 mins

## Ingredients:

Map with driving directions from Edinburgh, Scotland, Helsinki, Finland (2000 miles)

## Directions:

Each team needs to get to Finland to surprise their true love, who is working there. They must create a plan: timeline, what to bring, budget, etc.

Have each team present their plan. Look for over planning (hotel reservations for each night, where to eat, etc.) and under planning (no passport, no miles per day goal, etc.). Ask the teams what they would do if they found out half-way through the trip that their true love has just been transferred 1000 miles away in another direction.

## Learning Points:

 - The ROI on detailed planning isnâ€™t always there. It is near impossible to predict and to plan for every stop, every meal, every incident encountered on a road trip. But we can prepare for one day at a time, and inspect and adapt as we go.

- Correlate the change in plans with software development and how when the customers needs change, we must be able to adapt. This is in contrast to continuing on with the initial plan which may no longer be of any use to the customer (shelved software).
